<h1>Exponential Decay</h1>
<p>Suppose you have something like mass of radioactive isotope, where each small part of the mass has an equal chance of decaying over a small time step. Then the amount that decays over a time step will be proportional to the starting amount.</p>
  <p> We might even say that the rate of change of the mass of the isotope is proportional to the current amount. We model this with the equation f'(x) = ax, where ... </p>
