  <h3> Summary of Chapter </h3>
  
  <h4> Notational Conveniences</h4>
  <p> Rudin has a few notational conveniences early on that are listed as definitions, but are really a mix of notation and definition. They are essentially as follows: </p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>If $A$ is a set, $x \in A$ indicates $x$ is an element of $A$, and $x \not\in A$ indicates $x$ is not an element of $A$.</li>
    <li>If a set has no elements, it is the <i>empty set</i>. If it has at least one element, it is <i>nonempty</i>. Rudin gives no special symbol for the empty set, but $\emptyset$ is common here.</li>
    <li>If there are sets $A$ and $B$ with every element in $A$ as a member of $B$, then we say $A$ is a subset of $B$ and write $A \subset B$ (or $B \supset A$). (This notation seems to be falling out of favor - I will elaborate soon enough.)</li>
    <li>If $A \subset B$ and there is an element of $B$ that is not an element of $A$, then we may say $A$ is a <i>proper subset</i> of $B$.</li>
    <li>If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, then $A$ and $B$ are equal with respect to set elements, and we write $A = B$. Otherwise, we write $A \ne B$.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Note: Increasingly, some mathematicians see the use of $A \subset B$ to be ambiguous; some authors use it to indicate that $A$ is a strict subset of $B$ and use $A \subseteq B$ to indicate the possibility of set equality. Other mathematicians are opting for even more explicit notation for the strict subset case: $A \subsetneq B$. Anyone using this notation will generally use $A \subseteq B$ otherwise if $A$ is not necessarily a strict subset. To summarize:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Convention 1: $A \subset B$ indicates the subset relation, and is agnostic as to whether or not this is strict. (Rudin) </li>
    <li> Convention 2: $A \subset B$ indicates specifically a strict subset relation, and $A \subseteq B$ indicates otherwise. </li>
    <li> Convention 3: $A \subsetneq B$ indicates specifically a strict subset relation, and $A \subseteq B$ indicates otherwise. </li>
  </ol>

  <p> My personal preference is Convention 2, since having at least something to indicate strict set containment is handy for some proofs, but I feel like Convention 3 introduces clutter. Other mathematicians have other opinions, some quite strong. I will generally opt for Convention 2 just to have the notational convenience. </p>

  <h4> Ordered Sets </h4>

  <p> In this book and any other text in analysis and topology, set orderings are important structures. Specifically, they allow $ \lt $ and $ \gt $ to be defined as relations and used with all the power that entails. So here's how Rudin defines an order:</p>
  <p> Definition 1.5: Let $S$ be a set. An <i>order</i> on $S$ is a relation, denoted by $ \lt $, with the following properties: </p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>If $x \in S$ and $y \in S$, then one and only one of the following statements is true: $x \lt y$, $x = y$, or $y \lt x$. </li>
    <li>Given $x, y, z \in S$, if $x \lt y$ and $y \lt z$, then $x \lt z$.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> The second property is one called <i>transitivity</i>, which we will see later.</p>
  <p> Some other notational conveniences Rudin notes include the ability to write $y \gt x$ in the place of $x \lt y$, and that $x \leq y$ means either $x \lt y$ or $x = y$, making it the negation of $x \gt y$.</p>
  <p> Definition 1.6: An <i>ordered set</i> is a set $S$ in which an order is defined.</p>
  <p> Rudin has thus far used $\mathbb{Q}$ to indicate the rational numbers - those of the form $\frac{a}{b}$ for integers $a$ and $b$ - and suggesting their structure is not sufficient for our purposes, essentially foreshadowing the construction of the real numbers by pointing out the gaps in $\mathbb{Q}$. However, he does point out we can put the familiar order on $\mathbb{Q}$ by saying $r \lt s$ if and only if $s - r$ is a positive rational number.</p>
  <p> Again, Rudin uses convention that is not as specific as some authors like. Mathematicians like to specify sets as either partially or totally ordered. Rudin here seems to be using ordered as synonymous with totally ordered, which is fine for consideration of the rational and real numbers, but not necessarily for order relations on things like sets or graphs.</p>
  <p> Definition 1.7: Suppose $S$ is an ordered set and $E \subseteq S$. If there exists a $\beta \in S$ such that $x \leq \beta$ for every $x \in E$, we say that $E$ is <i>bounded above</i>, and call $\beta$ and <i>upper bound</i> of E.
  <p> This can all be swapped for the equivalent definitions of <i>bounded below</i> and <i>lower bound</i> where $\beta \leq x$ for every $x \in E$. </p>
  <p> Definition 1.8: Suppose $S$ is an (totally) ordered set, $E \subseteq S$, and $E$ is bounded above. Suppose further there exists some $\alpha \in S$ with the following properties:</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>$\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$.</li>
    <li>If $\gamma \lt \alpha$, then $\gamma$ is not a upper bound of $E$.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Then $\alpha$ is called the <i>least upper bound of $E$</i>, or the <i>supremum of $E$</i> and we may write $\alpha = \sup E$. Flipping signs as before, we may have the <i>greatest lower bound of $E$</i>, or the <i>infimum of $E$</i>, and write $\alpha = \inf E$.</p>
  <p> So what is essentially happening here: take as an example the numbers in $\mathbb{Q}$ that fall between $0$ and $1$. Note that every rational number greater than or equal to $1$ is an upper bound - so for example, $2$ is also an upper bound - but since $\frac{3}{2} \lt 2$ is also an upper bound, $2$ is not the <i>least</i> upper bound. It should be intuitive with such a straightforward example to see that $1$ is the least upper bound, and $0$ is the greatest lower bound, but manipulating suprema and infima is not always straightforward. Note that condition (ii) does do one convenient thing - in a totally ordered set, the supremum and infimum of a subset, if they exist, are unique.</p>
  <br>
  <p> This is probably the place to circle back to the example at the opening, because Rudin gives an example in $\mathbb{Q}$ to show that the supremum or infimum may not exist for all bounded sets. This requires a classical proof first: showing that $p$ such that $p^2 = 2$ is irrational. Then Rudin defines the rationals greater than $p$ and less than $p$, and demonstrates that there is no infimum for the former and no supremum for the latter, even though they are bounded below and above, respectively. So proceeding in that order:</p>
  <p> Example 1.1: The equation $p^2 = 2$ is not satisfied for any rational number $p$. </p>
  <p> The proof proceeds by supposing $p$ is rational, and arrive at a contradiction, leading to the conclusion that $p$ must not be rational. So suppose that $p$ is rational; if so, we could write $p = \frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ expresses the fraction in least terms. Specifically, $m$ and $n$ are not both even, for if they were, the fraction could be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator both by $2$. Since $p^2 = 2$, this allows us to say $m^2 = 2n^2$. This shows that $m^2$ is even (since $2$ is a factor on the right hand side). And if $m^2$ is even, it must be the case that $m^2$ is divisible by $4$ (since any factors in $m^2$ must be twice-repeated - note if $m^2 were odd, $m$ would have to be odd). But if $m^2$ is divisible by $4$, it must also be the case that the right hand side of the expression is also divisible by $4$, so that by the same argument as above, $n^2$ must be even, and so also $n$. But we started by assuming $m$ and $n$ were chosen in least terms such that both were not even, giving a contradiction. Therefore, the initial hypothesis that $p$ is rational and able to be expressed as a ratio of two integers is false.</p>
  <p> Notice the structure of the proof: To show $p$ does not have a certain property, suppose it does, and arrive at a contradiction. Therefore, $p$ does not have the property. This proof strategy is commonly called a proof by contradiction, but constructivists (those persnickity sorts) might be a little more particular and call this a "proof of negation" since it does not require passing through a double-negation elimination to arrive at the conclusion. The reason they make this distinction is that proof of negation is a valid strategy in most constructivist logics, but proof by contradition in the more strict sense of passing through a double-negation elimination is not necessarily.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Now, having shown that the square root of $2$ is not a rational number - that is, $p$ such that $p^2 = 2$ is not in $\mathbb{Q}$ - we can construct the bounded sets without supremum and infimum as described previously. Let $A$ be the set of all positive rationals $p$ such that $p^2 \lt 2$ and $B$ the set of all positive rationals such that $p^2 \gt 2$. First, we will show that $A$ contains no largest element and $B$ contains no smallest element. That is, for every $p \in A$, there is some $q \in A$ such that $p \lt q$; and similarly, for every $p \in A$, there is some $q$ such that $p \gt q$.</p>
  <p>Surprisingly, we can use the same construction of $q$ for both cases. For any rational $p$, define $q$ as follows:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"> $ q = p - \frac{p^2 - 2}{p + 2} = \frac{2p+2}{p+2}</p>
  <p> If we adopt this construction, we can derive the following expression to more readily check if $q^2$ is greater than or less than $2$:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"> $ q^2 - 2 = \frac{2(p^2 - 2}{(p+2)^2}
  <p> Note that $q$ is itself rational. Now, suppose $p \in A$. Then $p^2 - 2 \lt 0$. This tells us that $q \gt p$ since we're subtracting a negative, and also that $q^2 - 2 \lt 0$. Therefore, $q \gt p$ and $q \in A$. Therefore, given any proposed maximal element in $A$, we can always construct a greater element.</p>
  <p> Next, suppose $p \in B$. Then $p^2 - 2 \gt 0$. This tells us that $q \lt p$ since we're subtracting a positive value, and also that $q^2-2 \gt 0$. Therefore, $q \lt p$ and $q \in B$. Therefore, given any proposed minimal element in $B$, we can always construct a lesser element. </p>
  <p>Under construction</p>
