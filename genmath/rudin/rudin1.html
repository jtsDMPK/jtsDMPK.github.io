  <h3> Summary of Chapter </h3>
  
  <h4> Notational Conveniences</h4>
  <p> Rudin has a few notational conveniences early on that are listed as definitions, but are really a mix of notation and definition. They are essentially as follows: </p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>If $A$ is a set, $x \in A$ indicates $x$ is an element of $A$, and $x \not\in A$ indicates $x$ is not an element of $A$.</li>
    <li>If a set has no elements, it is the <i>empty set</i>. If it has at least one element, it is <i>nonempty</i>. Rudin gives no special symbol for the empty set, but $\emptyset$ is common here.</li>
    <li>If there are sets $A$ and $B$ with every element in $A$ as a member of $B$, then we say $A$ is a subset of $B$ and write $A \subset B$ (or $B \supset A$). (This notation seems to be falling out of favor - I will elaborate soon enough.)</li>
    <li>If $A \subset B$ and there is an element of $B$ that is not an element of $A$, then we may say $A$ is a <i>proper subset</i> of $B$.</li>
    <li>If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, then $A$ and $B$ are equal with respect to set elements, and we write $A = B$. Otherwise, we write $A \ne B$.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Note: Increasingly, some mathematicians see the use of $A \subset B$ to be ambiguous; some authors use it to indicate that $A$ is a strict subset of $B$ and use $A \subseteq B$ to indicate the possibility of set equality. Other mathematicians are opting for even more explicit notation for the strict subset case: $A \subsetneq B$. Anyone using this notation will generally use $A \subseteq B$ otherwise if $A$ is not necessarily a strict subset. To summarize:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Convention 1: $A \subset B$ indicates the subset relation, and is agnostic as to whether or not this is strict. (Rudin) </li>
    <li> Convention 2: $A \subset B$ indicates specifically a strict subset relation, and $A \subseteq B$ indicates otherwise. </li>
    <li> Convention 3: $A \subsetneq B$ indicates specifically a strict subset relation, and $A \subseteq B$ indicates otherwise. </li>
  </ol>

  <p> My personal preference is Convention 2, since having at least something to indicate strict set containment is handy for some proofs, but I feel like Convention 3 introduces clutter. Other mathematicians have other opinions, some quite strong. I will generally opt for Convention 2 just to have the notational convenience. </p>

  <h4> Ordered Sets </h4>

  <p> In this book and any other text in analysis and topology, set orderings are important structures. Specifically, they allow $ \lt $ and $ \gt $ to be defined as relations and used with all the power that entails. So here's how Rudin defines an order:</p>
  <p> Definition 1.5: Let $S$ be a set. An <i>order</i> on $S$ is a relation, denoted by $ \lt $, with the following properties: </p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>If $x \in S$ and $y \in S$, then one and only one of the following statements is true: $x \lt y$, $x = y$, or $y \lt x$. </li>
    <li>Given $x, y, z \in S$, if $x \lt y$ and $y \lt z$, then $x \lt z$.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> The second property is one called <i>transitivity</i>, which we will see later.</p>
  <p> Some other notational conveniences Rudin notes include the ability to write $y \gt x$ in the place of $x \lt y$, and that $x \leq y$ means either $x \lt y$ or $x = y$, making it the negation of $x \gt y$.</p>
  <p> Definition 1.6: An <i>ordered set</i> is a set $S$ in which an order is defined.</p>
  <p> Rudin has thus far used $\mathbb{Q}$ to indicate the rational numbers - those of the form $\frac{a}{b}$ for integers $a$ and $b$ - and suggesting their structure is not sufficient for our purposes, essentially foreshadowing the construction of the real numbers by pointing out the gaps in $\mathbb{Q}$. However, he does point out we can put the familiar order on $\mathbb{Q}$ by saying $r \lt s$ if and only if $s - r$ is a positive rational number.</p>
  <p> Again, Rudin uses convention that is not as specific as some authors like. Mathematicians like to specify sets as either partially or totally ordered. Rudin here seems to be using ordered as synonymous with totally ordered, which is fine for consideration of the rational and real numbers, but not necessarily for order relations on things like sets or graphs.</p>
  <p> Definition 1.7: Suppose $S$ is an ordered set and $E \subseteq S$. If there exists a $\beta \in S$ such that $x \leq \beta$ for every $x \in E$, we say that $E$ is <i>bounded above</i>, and call $\beta$ and <i>upper bound</i> of E.
  <p> This can all be swapped for the equivalent definitions of <i>bounded below</i> and <i>lower bound</i> where $\beta \leq x$ for every $x \in E$. </p>
  <p> Definition 1.8: Suppose $S$ is an (totally) ordered set, $E \subseteq S$, and $E$ is bounded above. Suppose further there exists some $\alpha \in S$ with the following properties:</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>$\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$.</li>
    <li>If $\gamma \lt \alpha$, then $\gamma$ is not a upper bound of $E$.</li>
  <p> Then $\alpha$ is called the <i>least upper bound of $E$</i>, or the <i>supremum of $E$</i> and we may write $\alpha = \sup E$. Flipping signs as before, we may have the <i>greatest lower bound of $E$</i>, or the <i>infimum of $E$</i>, and write $\alpha = \inf E$.</p> 
  <p>Under construction</p>
