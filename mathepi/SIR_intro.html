<h1>The SIR model and the introduction to the idea of $R_0$</h1>

<p>Long ago I had popular thread on a social media site about the dynamical systems perspective of the reproduction number $R_0$ (R-naught). Here, I walk through it
similarly to my treatment from before. The main pre-requisite is a solid understanding of calculus - in particular, knowing that a negative derivative means a function is decreasing
and a positive derivative means it's decreasing. It helps a lot if you've seen differential equations in the past and are comfortable with equations with multiple
variables as well, but it's not at all required to know how to find analytic solutions to differential equations.</p>

<p>So first, a preliminary: $R_0$ is a general term describing the reproductive capacity of an organism. 
In epidemiology it refers to the number of secondary cases that result from a single case in an entirely susceptible population.
One might also encounter it in an ecological context as well, referring to the average number of offspring for an organism. The
base idea, that reproduction above replacement rate is typically required for population growth, is the same in both contexts. It's
a pretty common theme that ideas in math-epi have analogues in population dynamics, with diseases playing roles as predators and
hosts analogous to prey.</p>

<p> To give a little taste of how the mathematical side of some of these models looks,
I'm going to introduce you to one of the most humble and familiar models a mathematical epidemiologist will encounter: the SIR model.
It's named as such because it's a system of three differential equations, one for each "compartment" of people: 
Susceptible, Infectious (or Infected), and Recovered classes. </p>

<p> We'll be using $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$ to denote the populations in each class at a given time $t$. For simplicity in notation, 
  we often just use the letters $S$, $I$, and $R$ without the $(t)$ designation. Here's the system (isn't it cute?): </p>

  <p>
  $$\begin{aligned} 
  \frac{dS}{dt} &= \Lambda - \beta SI - \mu S \\ 
  \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta SI - \alpha I - \mu I \\ 
  \frac{dR}{dt} &= \alpha I - \mu R 
  \end{aligned}$$
  </p>

  <p> If you're familiar with calculus notation, you'll recognize that $\frac{dS}{dt}$ denotes the change over time of $S(t)$, which refers to the susceptible class.
    But what's going on with the right-hand side? First, we've got some stuff we call "demography" - birth and death rates denoted as $\Lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively.
    We don't have anything complex like mating dynamics - we just have a constant birth rate $\Lambda$ - but that's ok, it's the kind of simplification we make when 
    the model isn't being used to study that, and that allows us to get some traction analyzing the model. The death rate, $\mu$, is not time-dependent. This is another
    simplification. It amounts to saying that the rate of death is constant at all times for the population - an exponential decline term.
    Again, we're not doing any complex modeling of lifespans here, so it's reasonable for our purposes. We'll talk about the demography a little more when we get to the
    disease-free equilibrium (DFE). </p>

    <p>Since we're using this model to talk about disease dynamics, the most important term here is the $\beta S I$ term. Being negative, the term indicates individuals leaving
    the susceptible class. So they leave the class, and they're not dying. Where do they go? </p>
  
  <p>Well, if we look ahead to the infected class, $I$, we see this is where they go when they leave. If you've ever looked at chemical kinetics, you might recognize this as a mass action interaction, where the rate of a reaction is directly
      proportional to the concentrations of the reagents. For the sake of the analogy here, an interaction between a susceptible person and an infected person produces
    a new infected person, with force of infection $\beta$. So the infected class grows with this mass action term as infected individuals create more infected individuals
  from among the susceptible population.</p>

  <p> What else do we have on this line? Well we have the demography again in the $-\mu I$ term, indicating a natural death rate - natural in that it's the same as the susceptible
    class, so we don't have any disease-induced death here - and a $-\alpha I$ term. So for those, again - if they're not dying, where are they going?</p>

  <p> Look ahead once more at the last line, where we have the change in time for the recovered class, $\frac{dR}{dt}$ encoded. Note here we have a positive $\alpha I$ term
    to match the negative term in the infected class - so this is where they go! So $\alpha$ is the recovery rate for the infection. The only way people leave the recovered class
    is through natural death, $\mu R$.</p>

  <p> Since that's a lot of text and equations, let's summarize with a flow chart: </p>
