<h1>The SIR model and the introduction to the idea of $R_0$</h1>

<p>Long ago I had popular thread on a social media site about the dynamical systems perspective of the reproduction number $R_0$ (R-naught). Here, I walk through it
similarly to my treatment from before. The main pre-requisite is a solid understanding of calculus - in particular, knowing that a negative derivative means a function is decreasing
and a positive derivative means it's decreasing. It helps a lot if you've seen differential equations in the past and are comfortable with equations with multiple
variables as well, but it's not at all required to know how to find analytic solutions to differential equations.</p>

<p>So first, a preliminary: $R_0$ is a general term describing the reproductive capacity of an organism. 
In epidemiology it refers to the number of secondary cases that result from a single case in an entirely susceptible population.
One might also encounter it in an ecological context as well, referring to the average number of offspring for an organism. The
base idea, that reproduction above replacement rate is typically required for population growth, is the same in both contexts. It's
a pretty common theme that ideas in math-epi have analogues in population dynamics, with diseases playing roles as predators and
hosts analogous to prey.</p>

<p> To give a little taste of how the mathematical side of some of these models looks,
I'm going to introduce you to one of the most humble and familiar models a mathematical epidemiologist will encounter: the SIR model.
It's named as such because it's a system of three differential equations, one for each "compartment" of people: 
Susceptible, Infectious (or Infected), and Recovered classes. </p>

<p> We'll be using $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$ to denote the populations in each class at a given time $t$. For simplicity in notation, 
  we often just use the letters $S$, $I$, and $R$ without the $(t)$ designation. Here's the system (isn't it cute?): </p>

  <p>
  $$\begin{aligned} 
  \frac{dS}{dt} &= \Lambda - \beta SI - \mu S \\ 
  \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta SI - \alpha I - \mu I \\ 
  \frac{dR}{dt} &= \alpha I - \mu R 
  \end{aligned}$$
