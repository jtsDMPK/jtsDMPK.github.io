<p> Kunze's model for estimating renal clearance </p>
<p> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jps.23851"> Kunze et al., 2014 </a>
  
<p> Renal clearance is one of the major contributing mechanisms for removing a drug from the body. Though lots of drugs are primarily 
cleared by metabolic routes, like the liver, others, such as antibiotics and antivirals, are primarily renally cleared. This paper uses a simplification
  (and a popular one) in simplifying the kidney's activity down to three components - filtration, secretion, and reabsorption. </p>
