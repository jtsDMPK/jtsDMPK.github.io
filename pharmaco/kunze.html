<p> Renal clearance is one of the major contributing mechanisms for removing a drug from the body. Though lots of drugs are primarily 
cleared by metabolic routes, like the liver, others, such as antibiotics and antivirals, are primarily renally cleared. This paper uses a simplification
  (and a popular one) in simplifying the kidney's activity down to three steps in the process of passing drugs from the bloodstream to urine
  - filtration, secretion, and reabsorption. </p>
